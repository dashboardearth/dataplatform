# dataplatform
This is the aggregation, synthesize and analysis platform to supply Dashboard.Earth services with data

#overview
In order to build various user interfaces, services, platforms, partner integrations and all other future aspects of Dashboard.Earth it is required we create and maintain a data platform to bring in global climate, weather, condition and geo data from as many sources as possible.

This platform must aggregate data from a variety of sources operating on different collection timescales and data fidelity.  The platform will normalize, cleanse and present data to downstream applications in a unified and immediately usable form.
